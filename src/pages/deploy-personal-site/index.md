# Intro

Publishing a personal site got very easy these days. 
There many ways of doing that.
In this article I wanted to describe you how I made my setup for this page.
Because I had little experience or opportunity  

My requirements were:
 - minimum effort to setup and operate
 - easy to author new articles
 - zero or no cost of hosting
 - my personal domains (mlynarski.cc and wieslaw.mlynarski.cc)
 - continuous integration
 - easy way of authoring articles
 - code can be public
  
## Tools and Services

The tools I chose for this are 

- [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Travis Ci](https://travis-ci.org/)
- [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com)
